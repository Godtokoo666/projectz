Python LAN Chat

## Before Start
Before the project is launched on your device, make sure you have the Python3 environment and the third-party library PyQt6 on your device!

## Start
Then you can run /Server/server.py to start Server,run /Client/login.py to start client.

Client can be launched repeatedly under the same IPv4,as their port is randomized,.But the server can only launch in one,for its IPv4 and port is unique.
